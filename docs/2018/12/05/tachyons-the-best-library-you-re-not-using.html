<h1 id="tachyons-the-best-library-youre-not-using">Tachyons, the best library you're not using</h1>
<p>My professional focus hasn't been on front end development for quite some time. However, since I tend to work solo on most of my data-oriented projects there is an unavoidable amount of HTML/CSS work that needs to get done.</p>
<hr />
<p><small class="muted monospace">DECEMBER 5, 2018</small></p>
<p>For the past five years I've relied on the <a href="https://purecss.io/">Pure CSS</a> library, more recently an off-shoot of my own called <a href="https://pimbrouwers.github.io/hydrogen/">Hydrogen</a>. Both are lightweight libraries, following SMACSS, and allow you to rapidly construct elegant UIs. Like most, I used a pre-processor and inevitably ended up writing a moderate amount of custom CSS to work in conjunction with the library.</p>
<p>Given my propensity for experimenting with new (for me) technology, I recently came across <a href="https://mithril.js.org">Mithril</a>, which I haven't been able to use in production yet. But I am hopeful to do so soon. In exploring Mithril's documentation, I came across an area regarding CSS where the creators/maintainers of Mithril go over applying their ethos of simplicity to CSS. They go on to describe an approach whereby we use plain-old CSS, avoid nesting, use single-class selectors, develop a naming convention and place CSS rules on a single line. At first, I thought &quot;boy that sounds stupid&quot;. The post goes on to introduce Tachyons, a functional CSS library that establishes a single class-to-rule philosophy. Think <code>&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-red&quot;&gt;</code> vs <code>&lt;button class=&quot;bg-red br2 bw0 mb1 pa1 white&quot;&gt;</code>, where the former is the traditional multiple class-to-rule and the latter is the functional single class-to-rule approach. Again, at first I thought &quot;boy that looks stupid&quot;.</p>
<p>None the less, being open-minded I thought why not give it a try. As an experiment, I took a UI I had already done using the traditional approach, which took about 2 weeks and was around 1000 lines of custom CSS. Using Tachyons I was able to remake the UI in under 2 days, and reduced the lines of custom CSS to 11. Yes, you read that correctly, 11 lines of code.</p>
<p>So what made the process so much faster? It had nothing to do with Tachyons being some silver bullet. But rather, the DRAMATIC reduction in time lost navigating code and task-switching. Since Tachyons follows a specific naming convention, and strictly follows the single class-to-rule approach. All of this means you construct your styles functionally in your markup, reducing the task-switching (from HTML to CSS) to almost zero. What's more, learning the Tachyon syntax is dead simple, as the un-minified source serves as the documentation (although the docs are phenomenal). Bundled together, this yields huge time savings, makes debugging non-existent and gets your to production faster.</p>
<p>Bottom line here is that if you do any amount of front end work, you most definitely need to give the Tachyons library a shot.</p>
