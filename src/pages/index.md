# Hi, I'm Pim. 
## A builder of digital things.

Rooted in an ethos of simplicity, I'm a passionate problem solver, serial learner and team player. A full stack developer by trade, specializing in high performance software, data architecture, ETL & ELT scenarios and cloud architecture. Possessing a particular penchant for C#, SQL Server & .NET Core with a budding interest in Go & Mithril.

It is my passion in life to acquire knowledge by doing, a process which Iâ€™ve come to learn can be summarized as: do-fail-repeat. 

When I'm not working at the [NHLPA][nhlpa], I [ramble][twitter] on Twitter, [write][write] occasionally, (try to) [help][help] other developers write better code, [dabble][photography] in photography, and [contribute][open-source] to open-source.
