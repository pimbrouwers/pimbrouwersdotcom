# Hi, I'm Pim.

A Chuck Taylor-wearing, chair-raving, programming robot. I ~~like~~ love making databases harder, better, faster, stronger. Specializing in database design, query optimization, performance tuning and ADO.NET integrations. With a budding interest in database administration. When I'm not working at the [NHLPA][nhlpa], I [ramble][twitter] on Twitter, [write][write] occasionally, (try to) [help][help] other developers write better code, [dabble][photography] in photography, and [contribute][open-source] to open-source.
