# Hi, I'm Pim.

A polyglot engineer with an ethos rooted in simplicity. I'm a problem solver, serial learner, performance junkie, and full-time builder of digital things. Specializing high performance systems, daemons & task automations, information architecture and application integrations. With a particular interest in Go. Captivated by its powerful simplicity and how productive it allows me to be.

It is my passion in life to acquire knowledge by doing, a process which Iâ€™ve come to learn can be summarized as: do-fail-repeat. 

When I'm not working at the [NHLPA][nhlpa], I [ramble][twitter] on Twitter, [write][write] occasionally, (try to) [help][help] other developers write better code, [dabble][photography] in photography, and [contribute][open-source] to open-source.
