As a KnockoutJS developer, I am admittedly biased toward the advantages of the small-but-mighty library. 
I’ll start off but with what Knockout **isn’t.**
* It is a library (not a framework), intended to work in unison with your other technologies.
* A complete solution. You’ll often add additional libraries to suit your use-case (ex:  to implement routing you could add in Sammy.js)
* Slow. If done correctly (deferred updates, using pure computed functions and binding to prototypes) you can squeeze tremendous performance out 
What Knockout **is.**
