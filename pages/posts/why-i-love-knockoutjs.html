<h1 class="blog-title">Why I LOVE Knockout.js</h1>

<p>I love Knockout.js. Aside from SQL, no technology I've encountered has inspired me quite to the level Knockout has. There's a captivating elegance to it's simplicity, and by proxy the ease in which you can learn it. And despite it's simplistic nature, it can transform JavaScript previously bound for spaghetti-town into artful solutions. It is my tool of choice for any project, of any scale, requiring any JavaScript. It enforces organization (components, custom bindings, extensions) without imposing conventions.</p>

<p>Knockout is a data-centric JavaScript library, enabling you to bind data to your DOM. At it's core, this is all Knockout does. Exposing a simple pub/sub concept, dubbed an "observable" (there is of course much more to it). Using the observable enables you to build reactive client-side applications with minimal effort.</p>

<p>What Knockout <strong>isn't</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A framework. It is a library, intended to work in unison with your other technologies.</li>
	<li>A complete solution. You'll often add additional libraries to suit your use-case (ex: to implement routing you could add in Sammy.js)</li>
	<li>Slow. If done correctly (deferred updates, using pure computed functions and binding to prototypes) you can achieve tremendous performance.</li>
	<li>Only good for small projects. Knockout can scale amazingly, I've built/worked on several large-scale projects with great success.</li>
	<li>Equipped with training wheels. Unlike other JavaScript libraries/frameworks, Knockout is wildly unopinionated and leaves virtually all the decision making to you. If you're a seasoned engineer, or working with one, this can be a tremendous positive.</li>
</ul>

<p>What Knockout <strong>is</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Awesome.</li>
	<li>Focussed. It offers several core concepts, that serve as a foundation for building modern data-drive client applications.</li>
	<li>Adaptive. It is small enough to be justifiable on small projects, and powerful enough to use on large applications.</li>
	<li>Empowering. Using Knockout puts the decisions in your hands, you will build it all and thus understand it all. My favorite analogy is a carpenter building a piece of furniture vs. an individual putting together a piece of Ikea furniture.</li>
	<li>Organized. Once you begin thinking like a "Knockout" programmer, you can achieve a wonderful separation of your view logic, event handlers, components and data bindings.</li>	
</ul>

<p>As someone who uses Knockout daily, I am admittedly biased toward the advantages of the small-but-mighty library. But the power in the small concepts it exposes, are undeniably amazing. I highly recommend giving it a <code>this.peek()</code> on your next project.</p>
